The selected code performs a spatial analysis using a Poisson regression model to understand the factors influencing tuberculosis (TB) cases in different subcounties. Here's a breakdown:
Import Libraries: It imports numpy for numerical operations, pandas for data manipulation, and statsmodels.formula.api and statsmodels.api for statistical modeling.
Define Data: It defines lists for subcounty names and arrays for hypothetical data on TB cases, population, HIV prevalence, and poverty rate for each subcounty.
Define Adjacency Matrix: It creates an adjacency matrix representing the spatial relationships (neighbors) between the subcounties.
Row-Standardize Adjacency Matrix: It converts the adjacency matrix into a row-standardized weight matrix, where each row sums to 1. This is used to calculate the spatial lag.
Calculate Spatial Lag: It calculates the spatial lag of TB cases by multiplying the weight matrix by the array of TB cases. The spatial lag for a subcounty is the weighted average of TB cases in its neighboring subcounties.
Create DataFrame: It creates a pandas DataFrame to organize all the data, including subcounty names, TB cases, population, HIV prevalence, poverty rate, and the calculated spatial lag of TB cases.
Calculate Log of Population: It calculates the natural logarithm of the population, which is used as an offset in the Poisson regression model. This helps to account for the different population sizes in the subcounties.
Display DataFrame: It prints the created DataFrame to show the organized data.
Define Formula: It defines the formula for the Poisson regression model, specifying that TB cases are dependent on HIV prevalence, poverty rate, and the spatial lag of TB cases.
Fit Poisson Regression Model: It fits a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a Poisson distribution and a log link function. It uses the defined formula, the DataFrame, and the log of population as an offset. Note the import of sm.families from statsmodels.api for specifying the Poisson family.
Print Model Summary: It prints the summary of the fitted model, which includes the estimated coefficients, standard errors, p-values, and other statistics to assess the model's fit and the significance of the predictor variables.
In essence, this code sets up and runs a spatial regression model to see how HIV prevalence, poverty rate, and the level of TB in neighboring areas (spatial lag) are associated with the number of TB cases in each subcounty, while accounting for population size.
