The Poisson regression model was used to examine the relationship between TB cases and three key predictors: 
HIV prevalence, poverty rate, and spatially lagged TB cases, while adjusting for population size using 
the natural log of population as an offset. The model shows a good fit given the small sample size, 
with a pseudo R-squared value of 0.6345, indicating that approximately 63% 
of the variation in TB cases across the subcounties is explained by the predictors.
The coefficient for HIV prevalence is 9.90 and is statistically significant (p = 0.014).
When exponentiated, this translates to an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of approximately 19,891, 
suggesting that a one-unit increase in HIV prevalence 
(e.g., from 0.25 to 1.25) is associated with nearly 19,891 times higher TB incidence.
While the magnitude seems extreme due to the scaling, 
it clearly indicates a strong and significant positive relationship between HIV prevalence and TB cases. 
In contrast, the coefficient for poverty rate is -0.11, 
which yields an IRR of about 0.89 (or an 11% decrease in TB rate per unit increase in poverty), 
but this effect is not statistically significant (p = 0.981). Similarly, 
the spatial lag of TB cases has a coefficient of -0.033 (IRR â‰ˆ 0.97), 
indicating a weak and non-significant relationship with local TB incidence (p = 0.432).
Overall, the model suggests that HIV prevalence is the only statistically 
significant predictor of TB incidence in this dataset, while poverty and TB cases in neighboring 
subcounties do not show meaningful effects. 
These results should be interpreted cautiously due to the very small sample size (7 subcounties), 
which limits statistical power and may affect the stability of estimates.
