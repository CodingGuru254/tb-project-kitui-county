üè• Implications for TB Control in Kitui County
1. Integrate Molecular Surveillance
Subcounties like Mutomo and Mwingi Central with high resistant strain counts should be flagged for routine genotyping and resistance profiling.

Use resistance mutation profiles to adapt treatment regimens early, reducing transmission of MDR-TB.

2. Target HIV/TB Co-infection Hotspots
Strengthen HIV testing and ART linkage in high HIV/TB overlap areas (e.g. Kitui East).

Deploy integrated care units in those facilities.

3. Enhance Spatial Surveillance
Use the spatial lag insights to monitor bordering subcounties‚Äîe.g. a rise in TB in Mwingi East may foreshadow increases in Kitui South.

Implement active contact tracing in these high-risk zones.

4. Treatment & Diagnostics
Stock second-line drugs in subcounties with detected mutations like katG_S315T or rpoB_S531L.

Prioritize GeneXpert and WGS access where drug resistance is growing.

üìå Summary for Health Officers:
This model provides a data-driven framework for:

Early warning of TB flare-ups due to drug resistance

Prioritized allocation of diagnostics and treatment

Integrated control of TB/HIV in high-burden zones

Enhancing regional strategies by including spatial dynamics and genetic insights
